**!! IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION !!**

===============================================================

THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES GENERAL CALCUATIONS FOR REDUCING SUBSTANCE USE.

THIS TOOL MAY HELP YOU TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, BUT DOES NOT REPLACE MEDICAL ADVICE ABOUT THE SAFETY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS THE PLAN THE PROGRAM MAY SUGGEST.

**MEDICAL CONSULTATION SHOULD BE MADE WHEN DESIGNING A SUBSTANCE REDUCTION PLAN.**

**STOPPING SOME SUBSTANCES ABRUPTLY OR TOO RAPIDLY CAN LEAD TO HARM OR DEATH.**

THE PROGRAM MAKES **NO ATTEMPT** TO DETERMINE WHAT SUBSTANCE YOU ARE USING IS; OR IF THE REDUCTION REQUESTED BY THE SOFTWARE PARAMETERS IS DANGEROUS.

STOPPING SOME SUBSTANCES, PARTICULARLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEUQNCES, LOSS OF EFFICACY, OR OTHER UNDESIRABLE OUTCOMES.

===============================================================

*LIMITATIONS*

This program can only perform straight reductions over time. It cannot account for scenarios where one substance is to be tapered down in conjunction with another being tapered up.

Because it cannot know what substances are being reduced, it makes no effort to round reductions to a typical full dose. Compliance may require careful measurements of supplements or other substances.

As of this release, it can only perform a singular reduction pattern (linear with adjustments). Future versions may implement additional reduction curves.
